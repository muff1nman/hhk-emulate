The hhk.xkb file was generated while using a Black Widow Ultimate nearly US
layout keyboard.  Then, everything was stripped off except for the keycodes
section which was dumped into partial.  This partial file is installed and can
then be used to change your layout:

setxkbmap -layout hhk

If you find anything that could use improving, let me know!
